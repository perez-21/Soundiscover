 Recommends new music on spotify based on stuff you don't listen to often

 # Note
 * You'll need to login to spotify for developers with a spotify account
 * You'll need to a _client id_ and _client secret_. Spotify provides them when you create a new app in your dashboard.<br>Replace the _client id_ and _client secret_ values with yours in the .env file.
 * You'll need to set the redirect url to <https://127.0.0.1:5000/callback> or what you want in your app settings<br>If you decide to use a different redirect url, remember to change the redirect url in the code as well.
